# Reduction of `TaoFivePrimes.rosser_schoenfeld_theta_lower_analytic`

Target (Rosser--Schoenfeld 1962, Theorem 4, eq. (3.14)):

    for every real t >= 1340,   t * (1 - 1 / (2 log t)) < theta t.

The reduction splits the range on t:

* `1340 <= t <= 1420`: the already proved platform theorem
  `TaoFivePrimes.rosser_schoenfeld_theta_lower_finite` gives
  `t - 2 sqrt t < theta t`, and `t * (1 - 1/(2 log t)) <= t - 2 sqrt t`
  follows from `4 log t <= sqrt t` (proved here from `log 2 < 0.6931471808`
  and `1420 <= 2^11`).
* `1420 <= t <= 10^10`: the new child
  `TaoFivePrimes.rosser_schoenfeld_theta_lower_analytic_mid`.
* `10^10 <= t`: the published platform input
  `TaoFivePrimes.schoenfeld_psi_error_large` (the explicit two-sided
  Chebyshev bound `|psi t - t| <= t/(40 log t)`) combined with Mathlib's
  `Chebyshev.psi_sub_theta_le`, i.e. `psi t - theta t <= 2 sqrt t * log t`,
  which is the prime-power correction between the two Chebyshev functions.
  The numerical comparison `(19/40) sqrt t > 2 (log t)^2` on this range is
  proved from `log t <= 8 * t^(1/8)` (Mathlib's `Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos`
  applied to the eighth root, written as three nested square roots).

Nothing else is assumed: the file has no `sorry`, no `axiom`, and imports
only the three platform nodes named above plus Mathlib.
